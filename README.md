**Node.js Setup and Project Execution Steps**

1. **Download Node.js**  
   First, download and install **Node.js** from the official website:  https://nodejs.org/en

2. **Open the Project Folder**  
   Open your project folder and then launch the terminal.

3. **Navigate to the Backend Folder**  
   In the terminal, navigate to the **backend** folder by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

4. **Initialize the Project**  
   Initialize a new **npm** project by generating a **package.json** file automatically. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

5. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   Install the necessary dependencies for the project: **Express**, **CORS**, and **Nodemon**. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   npm install cors
   npm install nodemon
   ```

6. **Start the Application Using Nodemon**  
   To start the application with **Nodemon** (which automatically restarts the server when changes are made), run the following command:

   ```bash
   nodemon dashboard.js
   ```

   After running this command, you should see a message similar to the following in your terminal:

   ```
   [nodemon] 3.1.0
   [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
   [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
   [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,cjs,json
   [nodemon] starting `node dashboard.js`
   Server running on port 3000
   ```

7. **Open the Frontend (homepage.html)**  
   Now, navigate to the **frontend** folder and locate the **homepage.html** file. Right-click on the file and select the "Open with Live Server" option to view the page in your browser.

---

**Conclusion**

By following these steps, you will have set up your **Node.js** backend server using **Express** and **CORS**, and successfully run your project with **Nodemon**. Additionally, you will be able to view the **homepage.html** in the frontend using **Live Server**.
